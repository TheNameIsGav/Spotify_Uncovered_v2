You seem a bit sad, might I suggest ___
Wow... that's really loud. Maybe take a break?
Maybe you should lay off the caffeine for a bit, just a suggestion
Ahhh so you're the mellow type
Your music suggests you are doing great. Way to embrace "fake it till you make it"
You seem like you could use a pick me up. Grab a coffee and go for a walk
Have you heard of "chill"? You could use it
Aww you're happy AND energetic?? That's so nice... I guess :)
Feeling kinda meh, huh? It's okay we've all been there
I think you could stand to spice it up a bit. Not EVERY song needs to be a slow song
